// and returns the number of tennis balls it contains. 1 tennis ball sits on 4, the 4 sit on 9, 9 on 16.... return the sum
//
// Task 2: Write a recursive function to take in a positive integer and produce its unsigned binary equivalent,
// 13 will output 1101
//
// Task 3: Write a recursive function to estimate the fifth root of a given number
//
// Task 4: Write a recursive function to take in a non-negative integer and return its approximate value in the
// depth of Ramanujan equation, as well as test out the depth of infinity, for this function I will also pass in
// a counter with its use explained in the function definition
