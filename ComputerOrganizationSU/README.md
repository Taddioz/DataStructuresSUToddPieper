Assignment 1 - CPU Scheduling Algorithims
In this programming assignment I created a simulator that will simulate the execution of different CPU scheduling algorithms discussed in class.
In particular, the simulator implemented the following scheduling algorithms
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRT)
* Round Robin (RR)

Input is taken from known formatted text files.

Assignment 2 - 
Write a program for a basic command line shell using system calls that allows users to execute programs like a linux shell, ie. it should display a prompt and then execute the command the user enters. Also, using pthreads
write a multithreaded program to count the vowels in 20 different text files simultaneaously.

Note: Command.cpp and Command.h is a helper class provided by the instructor to help parse the commands for the shell we made. They were not written by me.

Assignment 3 -
Implementing a simple file system over a simulated disk represented as an array of blocks that could represent directories, i-nodes, or data blocks.
