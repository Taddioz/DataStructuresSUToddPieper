My code from my CPSC2600 Foundations of Computer Science class Seattle University, Language used for this class was optional and I chose C++ (11), 0 group assignments for this class all work is my own

Assignment 2 - Bitwise operations:
Very simple assignment, given subsets of universal set with ten elements of the numbers 0-9, perform some relational operations like union, difference, and combination. The trick was to only do so using bit vectors and bitwise 
operations with
them. STL and any other classes with data structures or bit operations were prohibited.

Assignment 4 - Graphs of vertices:
Given a text file properly formatted with a list of vertices. "Create" a graph and display its adjaceny matrix, perform a breadth first search at any given index, and perform a depth first search at any given index. 
DFS must have been implented using recursion.
