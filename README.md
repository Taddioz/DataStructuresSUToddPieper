This repository is a compilation of all code submitted for coursework during my time at Seattle University. The sections are broken down by each class I took that required code submission. Course descriptions are pasted
below along with the grade I received and a note about how I felt about the class. Descriptions of each assignment are in seperate text files within each course directory

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Structures - Grade 4.0
--
Description:
Fundamental data structures including binary search trees, heaps, priority queues, and hash tables. Abstract data type implementation and design. Code analysis using big O notation, recursion, and sorting algorithms.

Note:
This class developed my strong C++ skills that I was introduced to at Highline College. There were a lot of data strucutres to cover and so lecture was quick but I learned strong fundamentals and had
good practice implementing them. My teacher was very passionate about coding and teaching which made me love the course and love the language of C++.



Foundations of Computer Science - Grade 3.9
--
Description: 
Introduction to logic, applications of logic to computer science, functions, combinatorics, equivalence relations, methods of proof, induction, recurrence relations and recursion in programming languages, graphs, graph implementations and applications

Note: 
The coding in this class was minimal and simple to implement. The only difficulty was understanding the material which posed an interesting challenge as generally with school coding work I had harder times implementing than understanding problems
but this course flipped that around. It really helped me slow down to assess problems before attempting to work on solutions, not only for coding, but for all kinds of problems



Computer Organization - Grade 4.0
--
Description:
Computer system infrastructure, implementation, and design. Topics include operating systems, resource allocation and scheduling, concurrency, synchronization, virtualization, reliability,
networking, and security. Development of multithreaded concurrent programs and client-server networking programs.

Note:
I had a rough time being in class as it was a lot of the professor just reading information off of slides and it was hard to feel the importance or any connections of what we were learning until
we got introduced to a related assignment. Which I should say is the most fun I have had coding in my schooling thus far. The challenges were very tough and had me thinking about them all the time during
my link rides to school, my breaks at work, and in my dreams at night. That may seem awful but I loved it, I absolutely love thinking about code and trying my ideas when I can and this class helepd that 
flourish. The assignments when finsished are not overtly complicated and probably do not warrant such mind consumption but they certainly helped me develop problem solving approaches and general skills
as awell as solidify my understanding in the topics presented in the course.
